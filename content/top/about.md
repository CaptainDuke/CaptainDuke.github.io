## ***Hey Duke!***

I prefer this name since it implies the highest hereditary title in the Royal Famliy of Britain, as well as the same word "D" lies in my Chinese name.

I was born in Taiyuan, a northern capital city known as the hometown of noodles. I spent my joyful childhood there, also I made a group of friends for a lifetime, ***"Siblings"***

Since 2013, I left home and began my study period at the Gate of Southern China --- Canton (Guangzhou). At that moment, I was not realized that I would live here for such a long time. Now I regard it as my Second Hometown. Regretfully, I cannot speak Cantonese like native speakers yet. Maybe little little Duke would taught his father how to do it!

I got my bachelor degree from ***South China University of Technology***, where the ratio of male/female is 7 : 1. Well-known alumnus [***Vczh***](https://github.com/vczh) named it ***Royal Institute of Technoloty***. In the year of 2016, I became a exchange student, flying to New York, the USA. I finished the courses at ***[Rutgers Universiy](https://www.rutgers.edu/)***, which left myself an unforgetable memory.

After that, I went to The ***[University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/)***, studying Computer Science. Hong Kong is a magical downtown. I cannot express my complex sentiment to this city, praise, complement, regret, grieved. I condemn the violance happend since the year of 2019, which cast a shadow over this *Pearl of the East*. Finally, I got the master degree from HKU and return to Shenzhen.

Currently, I am a software engineer at Tencent, working on high performance computing in the field of artificial intelligence. A cutting edge area which inspires me moving forward.

I learned large-scale distributed training, modified and contributed to Tensorflow & Horovod source code, profiled performance with timelines and Vtune. Familar with CUDA Programming, Intel Intrinsic Instruction.

This website is used to record the study notes and share something interesting in my life.
